# Data

The data we'll be using is nearly 5000 tiff files of satellite images, this is about 3GB data and has been split into a training and test dataset. The data is available on JuypterHub 99, Downloadable from the [SciML kaggle competition site](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spiruel/leeds-sciml-seaice) and via [hugging face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cemachelen/Leeds_SciML_SeaIce_2023).

**Please follow the instructions in the Introductory Notebook**

## Introductory Notebooks

To kickstart the hackathon please choose one of the following methods:

1. [Google CoLab](http://colab.research.google.com/github/cemac/SciML_sea_ice_hackathon_2023/blob/main/Introduction_Google_CoLab.ipynb) *Please save a copy of this notebook in your own GoogleDrive and take advantage of free GPUs*
2. [Own Notebook Server](StandAlone.md) *If you have access to your own GPU's/ high spec resources please follow*  
3. [JupyterHub 99](JupyterHub99.md) *CPU Preloaded environment and Dataset to fall back on* **Available to Leeds university staff and students only**

## Tasks

In the Introductory Notebook provided we take you through building a UNet Model to create a predicted segmentation mask for the sea ice images, visualizing the results and submitting those results. Can you improve upon the model and get better results?
